# Horizon-3SAT
## Final Files
### 3A Files
Contains all code relevant to Triple Alpha including projector matrices generation, Helium and Hydrogen files, clauses, and code to print a 3A file until hard-coding is required.

### Problems
Contains all valid, generated 3-SAT problems. Validity is tested according to the BZF paper, and tested 50-100 times using Schöning's algorithm to ensure that the problems have a single, unique solution. 

## Solutions
Re-solved solutions and their assignments using Schöning's algorithm, and the BZF algorithm. 

## Other Files
For generating plots, the outline of the Schöning algorithm, the 3-SAT generation algorithm, etc.
